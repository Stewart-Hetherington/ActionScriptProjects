# Space Invaders Tutorial

This was an individual project I made for an introduction to digital media class. I built a space invaders demo after 
a brief introduction to Adobe Flash professional. We then had to upload the flash files to a blog and write
a detailed account on how a tutorial was followed and modified. I later developed my own html and css code
for this project and uploaded all files to github, however, screenshots of tutorial instructions cannot be displayed
on github so I have uploaded a folder containing all screenshots.
